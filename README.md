# Brett Commandeur's Development Blog

## Goals
- Build a website from scratch, introducing technologies to meet specific needs. 
- Complexity will develop as a solution to problems, rather than including 'because I should'. 
- Document specific choices in development to serve as a how-to guide for the learning audience. 
- 100DaysOfContent: Coding for the sake of content and audiences. 

## Usage

- View website locally with `hexo server` command
- Blog posts are stored in `source/_posts` directory
- Publish posts by committing to github (netlify will then update the live blog)
- Create posts with `hexo new post "${post-title}"`
