There's this piece of code on instagram, and it looks like this:

```js

// Universe
const properties = {
	energy: (mass, distance, time) => {
		return mass * (distance / time) * (distance / time)
	},
	mass: (energy, distance, time) => {
		return energy / (distance / time) * (distance / time)
	}
}
```

and for reasons just within my grasp, it is my favourite piece of code. 

Looking at it, I feel relaxed. Writing it, I feel productive. Learning it brings me this deeper understanding of life. Why? Because `e=mc^2` is my favourite formula. 

It is my *mystery of life*... Some kids dream of counting beyond one million. I dreamt of memorizing "e equals em see squared", which eventually became "energy equals mass times the speed of light squared (in a vacuum)". 

Now that I know **math** and **code** (and can type *very* fast), I can just write `e=mc^2` , and all that knowledge comes pouring into my brain. 

(To be continued).
