## Introduction

The goal here is to create more blog posts and practice the process of writing. I want something to escape into, and IA writer has provided the writing experience I've been looking for. Instead of having to develop it myself (which I initially was trying) it only cost me $40. Not to shabby. 

What you'll find below is a collection of words that came out of nowhere after a successful jam session for my new music project - The Fist City Bastards. We're a two piece band that has practiced 3 times now. We're making significant progress and leave every session feeling accomplished. 

Drumming brings with it a sense of euphoria that I know will pass. And depression may take over in its place. So what I'd like to do is allow for my blog to be a collection of writings that may or may not make sense. The way some people post poems on instagram I want to post streams of consiousness onto the internet. Why? To offer a window into the mind of a manic depressive. It's what I am. I've come to terms with that. Now comes the harder part of living with it. So here goes nothing...

## Background Music

This post was written to the album [Bon Iver by Bon Iver](https://open.spotify.com/album/1JlvIsP2f6ckoa62aN7kLn?si=p2oQkzDfSNuPN9QznuBTwQ)

## Fearlessly Posting What I've Written - An Exercise

I like talking. I like writing. I think it's important to capture these moments as a means of expressing myself and working through the waves of depression that follow the passing of euphoria. 

It's difficult to recognize symptoms of ADD or OCD and wanting them to go away. I'm tempted to write 'in reality' but don't know what reality looks like anymore. These are the writings of a manic depressive. By definition. I feel like I'm in the best place I've been in a while. Which is beautiful considering I was suicidal about 2 weeks ago. That's a tricky word. Suicidal. Suicidal to me is when death is an option. It's a means of escaping whatever lack I'm in. It's not real. And yet its problematic. I never would. But wanting to is the problem. And I've noticed a lack of empathy in that regard. 

As I write I notice a particular rhythm to the words I'm producing. They come out of no where and yet they make sense. This is a euphoric realization I typically get when high and here I am getting it after a creative workout. Drugs are a manipulation of brain chemistry. Creativity releases endorphins. Exercise releases endorphins. 

I am an artist. 

I am a recognizer of the way in which language flows. I am self conscious of my speaking patterns. I am self conscious of patterns. 

I focus on the process as a means of creating. When the process is locked down, surely creativity will flow, no? No. Process develops as a solution to the barriers of a creative endeavour. Romanticizing a process doesn't allow for actual trial and error. In fact, developing a process can impede the creativity a process is meant to facilitate. It becomes inhibited by a need to perfect the process before creation, and yet creation is what refines the process. 

Produce. 

Create.

Repeat until the beauty presents itself and becomes effortless because the process is simply muscle memory. We know what to do. We know where to find the files we worry about losing because we will tackle those problems when the arise. 

How do I capture this moment?

With a blog post. Here's what I want. I want a link to the music I'm listening to and I want this post to be read to this album. Let's be fearless. Let's experiment. It's who you are. And though it has been taken away, we can find it again. And we can breathe. I need to prove I'm not crazy. So let's open my mind to the world. And lets do it in a way that people can find. In a way that feels voyeuristic for them and not intrusive on my part. I forced my perspective on people and it drove me insane. And yet the tangling is becoming untangled. The knots are becoming untied. The Rubik's cube is falling into place as effortlessly as turning each side by side. You want self conscious vulnerable exposure of yourself via your art? Words are my art. Music is my art. Programming is my art. It is how I express myself while capturing the innermost desires that relate me to my fellow humans. As my robot side reveals itself. Whoops. And yet those who truly know me will laugh. Those who truly know me will not be afraid. Those who truly know me will love my enthusiasm. My drive. My insanity. It is not to be feared but celebrated. And yet I must be careful. I must realize that all my passion exists in the context of a greater reality. My brain is powerful. It can light up the streets. And even in that statement you can notice how it can be taken in different ways. Light up as illuminate, not burn. No one gets it. I don't get it. There's nothing to get. I fucked up. I fucked up hard. And yet here I am typing away on what has been yet another phenomenal night. 

What is the context? As you're listening to Bon Iver's self-titled album. The context is drumming for Fist City Bastards, my band. A band I drum in. How cool is that? My friend Patrick has acquired a sweet practice place north of Grant MacEwan University. It's dark and grungy and in a basement. The dungeon as Patrick calls it. And it feels like home. 

I lost my home along everything. Home is no longer a place. It is a feeling. Part of growing up. Garden State. A more thematically relevant movie than I can ever fully appreciate. Just means I have to watch it more. 

My tongue is too big for my mouth. My brain is too big for my head. I've outgrown this world. And yet still I am small, weak, and malnourished. It's what depression does. It loses sight of any reason to really try. It's a complacency in nothingness to a point where death is simply freedom from all that lack. I can't find a better word. Lack. Something's missing. And without it I'm in quiet agony. Which feels like hyperbole.

All this to say. I'm happy. I'm writing. And I want to keep writing, producing, creating. It's who I am.
