Reverse Engineering My #100DaysOfCode (Part One)
===============================================

Here's my thought process: 100 Days of Code is supposed to be *declaritive* in the sense that it requires "declaring": 
```
#100DaysofCode
```
at the beginning of your journey on twitter. That means it is designed to fail because it has a logical error; what if someone is only codes for 1 day, and then codes for 99 days the following day? Do they still get to post #100DaysOfCode? (This isn't exactly criticism, just an observation I've made and would like to try and improve upon.)

Now, what if we could instead implement a *functional* approach? What if #100DaysOfCode was a **function** of data, instead of a **object** of data? I'll clarify: Functional programming requires the **composition** of smaller building blocks. The blocks are each *something that can be done*. When these tasks form together to get an even larger task done, we've just solved a problem functionally. Instead, you could have a single object, such as #100DaysOfCode (the actual Twitter hashtag), as the starting point of a larger description; we *declare* this description and our programming makes it so. 

The end result of this thought process? I'm pretty sure I've completed #100DaysOfCode. The question is how many days *total* I've done, not the number of *days in a row I've completed*. Whenever I quit I feel like I've failed. 

But today I've been a web developer for about 10 years. I made my first website in Grade 10, and having graduated about 10 years ago (In approximately 2010). That's 10 years. Some people call that mastery! I'm just happy to call myself an expert. I learned the hard way needing to confront imposter syndrome and have come out the other side un-scathed. 

10 years of battling with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 10 years of intensive studying of design specifications and technical documents. All because I had 2 really solid ideas: the first was a podcast about boardgames, TableGamerWeekly (which my best friend later called Hex19), and the second was a Movie tracking application for your friends. These ideas were cutting edge in 2011, so I pursued development and entrepreneurship as hard as I could. The resulting stressed landed a total of 6 hospitalizations, most of which involuntary, all of which were needed. 

Man, its been a crazy decade. My friends, my family, they've supported me the whole way through. And though scathed, I've learned to be a better person to others and a kinder person to myself. I didn't expect this post to get so emotional, so thanks for bearing with me through this rollercoaster ride of thoughts. Our theme park is sure to best the others, no?Anyways, as we say in **binary**, let's turn that `10`, into a `2`.
