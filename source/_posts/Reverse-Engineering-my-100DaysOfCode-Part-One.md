## Here's my thought process.

100 Days of Code is supposed to be *declaritive* in the sense that it requires *declaring* `#100DaysofCode` at the beginning of your Twitter journey. That means it's technically designed to fail. There's a logical issue: what if someone only codes for `1` day, misses the next day and then codes for `99` more? Do they still get to post `#100DaysOfCode`? (This isn't exactly criticism, just an observation I've made and would like to try and improve upon.)

What if you could instead implement a *functional* approach? What if `#100DaysOfCode` was a **function** of data, instead of just an **object**? Functional programming requires the **composition** of smaller building blocks. And those blocks are, in turn, each *something that can be done*. When we have these tasks, and we form them together for an even larger task, we've just solved a problem. Functionally. Instead, you *could* have a single object, such as #100DaysOfCode (the actual Twitter hashtag), as the starting point of a larger description; we *declare* this description and our programming makes it so. 

## The End Result? 

I'm pretty sure I've completed #100DaysOfCode. The question is how many days *total* I've done, not the number of *days in a row I've completed*. Whenever I quit the `100` days, I feel like I've failed. But today I've been a web developer for about `10` years. Wait, *over* `10` years, I made my first website in Grade `10`, and having graduated about `10` years ago (In approximately `2010`). That's `10` years. Some definitions include that as **mastery**! I'm just happy to call myself an expert. I mean, at least I almost was at when I worked at Apple. 

## Ten More Years

So that's ten years of battling with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 10 years of intensive studying design specifications and technical documents. 10 years of battling imposter syndrome and coming out relatively unscathed. Lots of pain along the way, but hey, we've made it this far. 

All because I had two pretty solid ideas: the first was a podcast about boardgames, **TableGamerWeekly** (which my best friend later called **Hex19**); and the second was a Movie tracking application for your friends, called **Shoodsi**. These ideas were pretty cutting edge in 2011, so I pursued development and entrepreneurship as hard as I could. The resulting stress landed a total of 6 hospitalizations, most of which involuntary all of which were needed...

...Man, its been a crazy decade. My friends, my family, they've supported me the whole way through. And though bruised, I've learned to be a better person to others, and a kinder person to myself. I didn't expect this post to get so emotional, but thanks for bearing with me through this rollercoaster ride of emotions. Our theme park is sure to best the others, no? Anyways, as we say in **binary**, let's turn that `10`, into a `2`.
