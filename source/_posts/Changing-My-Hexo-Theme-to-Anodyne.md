## Discovering the Beauty of Anodyne

Not loving the "traditional" blog style that comes with the landscape theme, I ventured off to the [Hexo Themes page and sorted by "minimalist"](https://hexo.io/themes/index.html#minimalist). A theme called Anodyne caught my eye as clean, modern, and well documented. Huge shout out to Jonathan Klughertz for a beautiful theme and an even better on boarding experience. This guy understands user experience in a way that brings pride in using his work to better mine.
