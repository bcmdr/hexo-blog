There's a phrase I've been coming back to time and time again as I venture forward in developing my own productivity. The phrase is *sharpening the forks* and I use it to refer to tasks that **feel** important at the time but don't actually accomplish any larger-picture goals. 

Put differently, sharpening the forks is something you do when the restaurant is super busy and the customers have complained that the forks are too dull. What do you do as an accomplished server / restaurant owner? You sharpen them, of course! The question becomes whether or not to dedicate the next 30 minutes to sharpening the forks. When do we schedule it? Who do we put in charge?

I use this phrase as a sort of lucidity check. When you're training your brain to dream lucidly, you perform what are known as *reality checks*. You can count the fingers on your hand multiple times or look at a clock twice in a row. The idea is that when you're dreaming, your brain is filling in a lot of the information for you, and learning to recognize these gaps without panicking is a key component of learning how to wake up in a dream without waking up in real life. 

What about day dreaming? How do we catch ourselves and recognize we are **not** dreaming? How we do we ask ourselves if what we are doing in the current moment is actually benefiting the long term goals of the restaurant, or just cowering to the whims of nit-picky patrons. In the moment we may never know and may not be able to know; but, it's an important question to keep in mind: just because what we're doing is important to someone, doesn't mean its worth our time now. 

What I'm not saying is never sharpen the forks. It might be a cost effective means of utilizing older cutlery over purchasing new ones that may dull over time. But let's be honest. How often are people really complaining about the forks? And have they complained about them at all? Or, are we just preparing for an eventuality that will never actually come to pass? My guess is that, more than likely, there are tasks that are more deserving of your time, and such a task is not necessarily the needed priority for an already busy server or bus-person. The forks may need sharpening, yes. But what good is a sharp fork when your food needs work and your service isn't up to par. 

I'll relate this to programming as best I can, although I'm hoping the analogy writes itself. Have you found yourself renaming variables over and over in an attempt to make the code more readable? Have you agonized over that one line of code that you know can be written more succinctly or with a fancier API? I know I have. And I know that when I'm doing this I'm most likely sharpening the forks, procrastinating on harder problems like where to store my database, or how to actually get users. 

I hope *sharpening the forks* offers you, dear reader, as much clarity as I've gained from pondering it myself. I'm noticing more and more examples of sharpening the forks in my observations of busy work throughout the various industries I've come in contact with over the years. Even thinking about the grammar and spelling of this article has me questioning if I'm sharpening the forks.

Do we learn to live with dull forks? Or do we find a way to better prioritize these tasks in larger batches of busy work. Time will tell on this end. 

In the meantime, may your next bite be as delicious, if not moreso, than your last.
