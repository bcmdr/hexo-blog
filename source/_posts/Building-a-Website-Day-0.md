## What we have used so far:

Hyper as my command terminal to create the website directory
- `mkdir ~/Documents/Website && cd ~/Documents/Website`
- Where documents is my iCloud storage home. 

An index.html page to serve as the home page for content
- `touch index.html`

A Readme.md to serve as a homepage for documentation
- `touch README.md`

VS Code as my text editor of choice
- `code .`
- It's popular and powerful, a joy to use once you get used to it. 
- [Launching VS Code from the terminal with the 'code' command](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line)

Git and github as my source control and version history 
- `git init`
- Prefer netlify install of estabished git repos and proper .gitignore files.

A static site generator to convert my md blog posts into html. 
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Distractingly unfamiliar
- [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) - Uses node over ruby so I can bring over my js experience

Netlify as my webhost
- deploy to netlify button as my one step install of a server and github repo. although this didn't actually work, had to fresh install hexo as the netlify deploy deploys the official hexo website. 

Goal: create a blog post about my new mp3
