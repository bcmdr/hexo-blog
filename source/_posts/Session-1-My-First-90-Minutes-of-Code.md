## Begin 4:30PM on March 28, 2019

Today's post comes from the inspiration of my previous post on **90 Minutes of Code**. The goal is to work on a programming challenge for upwards of 90 minutes and see how it goes. 

The format recommends 10 minutes of blogging before we hit the code. This will allow us to brainstorm priorities and ensure we end up focusing on the right challenges. 

My blog, built with Hexo and hosted on Netlify, is my current interest. I noticed that I could add a new category of post called `Session` to join `Articles` and `Tutorial`. Having this new category makes way for a daily journal that doesn't "pollute" the other categories. 

Let's get started.

First step is to download my hexo blog from GitHub and figure out how categories are made. I have 2 existing categories so I should be able to figure this out relatively quickly.

I wonder if I can add a new category and if hexo will figure it out from there.... Let's find out. I'm going to `hexo new` and see what happens if I change the category from Articles to Sessions. Oh! I can make a post in hexo for this very session. 

`hexo new post "Session 1 - My First 90 Minutes of Code"`

I'll enter that into my terminal in my `hexo_blog` repository folder and copy in the body of this post up until this point. 

I'd like to build and preview the blog locally at this point so I'll `hexo server` as per my `README.md`. This didn't work as I got a "No layout: index.html" error. I remembered that Minos, the Hexo theme I'm using, is connected to my blog as a git submodule so it needs to be imported separately. 

I found this command `git submodule update --init --recursive` and ran it from the minos theme directory within my hexo blogs's themes directory and it installed. 

I ran `hexo server` again and it worked! Well some of it worked. I can see my blog post with the category of `Sessions` but no `Sessions` link in the nav bar. I probably have to configure the hexo config file so I'll find that in `_config.yml`. But! I have to update the config of the minos theme, not hexo itself. 

There's a `menu` object in the Minos theme config to which I can add `Tutorials: /categories/Tutorials`. This worked! I can now see *Sessions* in the nav bar.

Now for a point of reflection. I've been working now for 30 minutes and I've accomplished one of my goals. I notice that I'm enjoying blogging along side the programming because it helps me organize my thoughts and I can reference back to this later if I forget what I did. I'm also hoping there is some SEO relating to my error message and theme name. This format is pretty verbose and may be difficult to parse, but it's better than nothing and ultimately aids in my learning (plus it's fun!)

Let's post the change to the github after a quick test, allow Netlify to work its magic of updating my blog, check the live changes and take a 5 minute break.

I ran into some issues with pushing the changes of my submodule (the minos theme) but what worked is 

```
git branch add_sessions_category
git checkout master
git merge add_sessions_category
``` 

where `add_sessions_category` is an arbitrary name of the temporary branch from which to merge.

I `cd ..` back up to my main hexo directory, `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push`, head over to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and publish a deploy.

Code is live and working! Now for that break ;)

We are back! 90 minutes is feeling like a long time but the idea is to build that muscle of persisting through the struggle. My goal is to do this for upwards of 8-10 hours a day. Much like a workout can be hard, pushing through it is what makes us stronger. So lets keep going!

So let's stay with the blog. What else would we like to fix knowing that context switches are "expensive" and time consuming. We have it up so we may as well make the changes. It's like not moving the camera if you can get all your coverage in the same series of shot setups. Film school training is paying off!


## Continue 5:27PM on March 28, 2019

I have two UX issues with my blog.

First, the All Posts button does not make it obvious that it links to a timeline of all posts. I assume thats where we are on the homepage given its the first item of the navbar. But nope, it links to the archive. So lets' rename `All Posts` to `Archive`. We should find that in the minos theme config again (it was).

Next, I'd like to update the github link in the footer to be more descriptive and say 'View Source Code on Github'. This promotes recognition over recall and removes the ambiguity of what the github link will point to. This will likely be in the theme config. It wasn't! Instead I had to find footer.ejs in the minos template and add it there. While I was at it I added the Twitter icon link to the nav bar. I found myself drifting into minor design nitpicks and had to steer myself back to focusing and not making a bunch of little changes all at once (which might break something and I won't know which change is responsible).

## Closing Reflection at 5:50PM

My 90 minutes is approaching an end, with 10 minutes left. My biggest takeaway is that 90 minutes feels right; it's just enough time to solve multiple problems, requiring a break, coming back to work and beginning to drift into irrelevant changes. In my experience, all those phases are common if not necessary to the development process. #90MinsOfCode is about really committing a reasonable amount of time to go through a full development experience (frustration and tedium notwithstading). It feels like a mental workout and I'm satisfied with how much I got done. 

This reflection process was reinforced during my CMPUT 302 - Introduction to Computer Human Interaction Course â€“ in which reflections such as these are required and graded. Once you push past the feeling of "is this really necessary", you appreciate the methodology for what it can offer towards the quality of learning. 

Writing out your thoughts requires you to repeat what happened. Repetition is the key to learning. And writing out your thoughts in a linear fashion can help you stay organized, focused, and on track. 

See you next time!
