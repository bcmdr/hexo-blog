The time has come once again where needing a portfolio is vital to my success. That's a very formal way of saying I'm excited to get back into this! I've realized that all my little side projects are finally culminating into the confident identity of "developer/designer" that I've been working towards for years now. 

In less than an hour this morning I've been able to gather together the following projects as core to my portfolio:
- GoDo: A simple static web application.
- Fwd: A complex multi-user web application.
- Shallwi: A design agency business.
- BCMDR: A development blog using modern technologies (you are here).

I feel like I "need" a fifth, but I'm sure I'll figure that out.... actually wait. The 'fifth' element is my multi-pass (sick reference, yo). The fifth element is how they all tie together! There is a near future where I'll be able to walk into an interview and use my app, FWD, to show links to my portfolio pieces. Or, I can download my portfolio on github (hence the current project). Or, I can talk about the devlopment process, the design challenges, and the reasons I made these things to begin with: connecting people and allowing people to focus on what matters most!

The fifth element is me: the glue that holds this all together, the director that focuses the elements towards a final solution, vision, and goal. 

So why revamp the portfolio? Because I'm finally proud of it! I've worked my ass of for years self-teaching HTML, CSS, Javascript, Static Site Generators, Client-Side Rendering, Server-Side Rendering, Vue, React, Component-Based Architectures, etc (you get the idea) all because I'm passionate about the Internet's potential to connect people towards a shared enjoyment of life and the little things that make life in the modern age a joy to thrive within! 

I didn't expect myself to get philosophical with this post but it's so refreshing to realize that all is not lost; I can confidently bring all my work together in a way that reflects the way I think, work, and ultimately solve problems. I finally identify as hireable. Now it's time to prove it....
