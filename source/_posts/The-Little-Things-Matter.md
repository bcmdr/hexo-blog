Why did I spend the past 2 days trying to change the title of my GoDo app from 'Start, Focus, Repeat' to 'Start. Focus. Repeat.`? Because the little things matter! 

My portfolio is a pride piece that will ideally outlive me and I want to make sure each little detail is a reflection of my personal preference and taste. It's those rough spots on the new table you built that require hours more sanding or the blemish on a freshly polished glass that needs ones more wipe of the cloth. If it bugs me and it's fun to fix, why not? Just like adding brush strokes to a painting or that one extra line of detail to a sketched portrait, 'obsessing' over the small details can be beautifully relaxing. 

Additionally, trying to make this minor update revealed a number of issues that I buried under the rug what feels like years ago! Multiple code repos for the same app, links pointing in all different directions, and myriad other details I didn't catch when I was in the thick of development. 

Solidifying GoDo into version 1.1.1 was a major milestone in my development career. Version 1.0.0 meant I was confident in the core functionality. Version 1.1.0 meant I was confident in the core design language and visual style. And Version 1.1.1 meant all those little details were finally taken care of. 

It wasn't until I tried to use it a year later did I notice that things were wrong. The app wouldn't load and I noticed minor (let's call them) typos. GoDo is a dream app of mine that amazingly took me less than a week to develop given I was in the thick of learning Vue and #100DaysOfCode. It is the culmination of everything I had learned and valued up to that point of my self-teaching of web development. So if I'm not 100% satisfied with it... what might a potential user think?

Entering the development industry will require me to show restraint and to be ok with certain non-catastrophic bugs. As I've learned in CMPUT 302 at the University of Alberta (Introduction to Computer-Human Interaction), usability and accessbility is key, and as much as we'd like to adhere to our personal preferences, the budget and priorities of my employers will make certain changes non-feasible. 

So my portfolio is my playground. My zen garden. My rollercoaster of exploration. Perfection may not be attainable, but satisfaction certainly is.
